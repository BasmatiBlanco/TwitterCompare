There are two versions of this project. 

graph.py will give you the option to compare the tweets as either an aggregate of likes or as a graph.
twittercomparison.py will just compare two peoples tweets as aggregate. They are separate because graph.py is a mess.  
Twitter-Comp-GUI will use a GUI to make a simple graph, no option for it to just be text on command line. 

Next up, trying to make it run faster.
