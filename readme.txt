There are two versions of this project. 

graph.py will give you the option to compare the tweets as either an aggregate of likes or as a graph.
twittercomparison.py will just compare two peoples tweets as aggregate. They are separate because graph.py is a mess.  


project plan:
1. run smoother 
2. fix bugs
3. Graph tweet likes over time
4.add option to compare hashtag total likes instead of user. 
5. GUI
